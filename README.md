Hotel Bookings Data Cleaning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook dedicated to cleaning and transforming a hotel bookings dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis and modeling.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset Overview

Original dataset: 119,390 rows Ã— 32 columns

After cleaning & processing:

Train shape: (69,916 Ã— 86)

Test shape: (17,480 Ã— 86)

ðŸ”¹ Cleaning & Processing Steps

Removed duplicates and irrelevant features

Handled missing values and inconsistent data

Standardized column formats and data types

Reduced and restructured dataset into train/test splits

ðŸ”¹ Feature Engineering

New features were created to enrich the dataset, including:

total_guests â€“ combined count of adults, children, and babies

total_nights â€“ total nights stayed per booking

stay_duration â€“ length of stay in days
